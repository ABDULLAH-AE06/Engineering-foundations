## Position, Velocity, and Acceleration

In engineering, motion is described by how quantities change over time.

- Position describes where an object is.
- Velocity describes how fast position changes.
- Acceleration describes how fast velocity changes.

Velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time.
Acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time.

### Personal Insight

is this relationship logical?
- Ansewr: yes it is because acceleration measures how velocity changes over time.
- if velocity does not change, there is no reason for acceleration to exist.

What happens if accelration equals zero ?
-Ansewr: If accelration equals zero, velocity reamains constant .
-The object may be at rest or moving at a constant speed in a stright line.

How can you visualize this in the motion of an aircraft?
-Ansewr: In steady cruise flight, an aircraft ,aintains a constnt speed, and direction.
-In this case, accelration is zero because the forces action on aircraft are balanced.

### Instantaneous Rate of Change

Average velocity is calculated over a time interval.  
Instantaneous velocity represents the velocity at a single moment in time.

To find it, the time interval is made smaller and smaller.
